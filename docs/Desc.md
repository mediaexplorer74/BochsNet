# Project Description

This is a C# version of the famous Bochs IA-32 (x86) PC emulator written in C++.

I try to re-write the code using C# in a readable intuitive way. This is the only managed C# emulator for x86 CPUs.

The ultimate objective of Bochs.Net is to develop an emulator with excellent GUI that helps OS 
and computer engineering students to "see" memory and CPU statuses clearly and easily to be able to debug operating systems.

We welcome you to join our team to achieve this vision.
